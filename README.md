# MyBiz - Business Management Web App

## Overview
**MyBiz** is a web application designed to tackle the challenges of inventory tracking and sales management in small and medium-sized businesses. Inspired by real-world experiences while working in an agrovet business, **MyBiz** is aimed at reducing losses caused by poor inventory management and improving overall business performance.

By offering a centralized platform for tracking products, managing sales, and analyzing business data, **MyBiz** empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions and streamline operations.

## Why MyBiz?
The idea for **MyBiz** was born out of a personal experience:

- While working in an agrovet, I noticed recurring losses due to missed restocking opportunities and poor inventory tracking.
- With better tracking, sales improved, products were never out of stock, and overall business performance surged by up 40%.
- This led to the realization that a centralized system for inventory and sales management could benefit many other businesses.
